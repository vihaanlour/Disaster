      <h1>Hey! Need some help about Disaster?</h1>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h2>So first lets understand what is a Disaster</h2>
      <br />
      <p>A disaster is a serious problem occurring over a short or long period of time that causes widespread human, material, economic or environmental loss which exceeds the ability of the affected community or society to cope using its own resources</p>

    <h3>Hurricanes and tropical storms</h3>
    <p>Hurricanes are types of tropical storms that form in the southern Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, and eastern Pacific Ocean. Hurricanes affect millions of people who live along the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts each year. Parts of the Southwest United States and the Pacific Coast can also experience severe weather associated with hurricanes, which include tornadoes, floods, and heavy winds.</p>

    <h3>Landslides & debris flow</h3>
    <p>
      a landslide, masses of rock, earth or debris move down a slope. Debris and mud flows are rivers of rock, earth and other debris saturated with water. They develop during intense rainfall, runoff, or rapid snowmelt, changing the earth into a flowing river of mud or “slurry.” They can flow rapidly, striking with little or no warning at avalanche speeds (faster than a person can run). They also can travel many miles from their source, growing
      in size as they pick up trees, boulders, cars and other materials. Debris flows don’t always stay in stream channels and they can flow sideways as well as downhill.

    <h3>Thunderstorms and lighting</h3>
    <p>Lightning is a bright flash of electricity produced by a thunderstorm. All thunderstorms produce lightning and are very dangerous. If you hear the sound of thunder, then you are in danger from lightning. Lightning kills and injures more people each year than hurricanes or tornadoes; between 75 to 100 people.</p>

    <h3>Tornadoes</h3>
    <p>A tornado is defined as a strong rotating air column with vertical axis, which must have contact to the ground. In most cases a tornado is visible as a funnel cloud. ... The lifetime of a tornado is from a few seconds to more than half an hour; in very rare cases a tornado can also last over one hour.</p>

    <h3>Tsunamis</h3>
    <p>Tsunamis are giant waves caused by earthquakes or volcanic eruptions under the sea. Out in the depths of the ocean, tsunami waves do not dramatically increase in height. But as the waves travel inland, they build up to higher and higher heights as the depth of the ocean decreases.</p>

    <h3>Winter and ice storms</h3>
    <p>
      An ice storm is a type of winter storm characterized by freezing rain, also known as a glaze event or, in some parts of the United States, as a silver thaw. The U.S. National Weather Service defines an ice storm as a storm which results in the accumulation of at least 0.25-inch (6.4 mm) of ice on exposed surfaces.[2] They are generally not violent storms but instead are commonly perceived as gentle rains occurring at temperatures just below
      freezing.

      <h1>Man made disasters</h1>
      <p>Man-made disasters have an element of human intent, negligence, or error involving a failure of a man-made system, as opposed to natural disasters resulting from natural hazards. Such man-made disasters are crime, arson, civil disorder, terrorism, war, biological/chemical threat, cyber-attacks, etc.</p>
